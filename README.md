# Updated-WebDev-Portfolio


This is my portfolio so far in the boot camp. Although I have mastered many areas of application and software development, there are still some challenges that come with the program that i believe I can work through as the program  progresses. I have learnt a lot and used a variety of tools that prior to this haven't heard of or had the ability to use. 

I know this site is not the perfect site, but I will continue to improve  on the site with all the knowledge i have gained and will continue  to gain as the we go along.

Enjoy!!
